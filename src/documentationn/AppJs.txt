#Explanation and Functionality

1. Routing
The app uses react-router-dom for navigation between pages.

<Router>: Wraps the entire app to enable routing.

<Routes> and <Route>: Define individual routes:

##Static Routes:

/: Displays the Home component.

/login: Displays the Login component.

/register: Displays the Register component.

/product: Displays the Product listing page.

/order: Displays the Order management page.

/cart: Displays the Cart page.

/thankyou: Displays the ThankYouPage after purchase.

##Dynamic Routes:
/product/:productId: Dynamically displays the SingleProduct component based on the productId parameter in the URL.

2. Context Management
CartContextProvider: Wraps the app to provide a global state for managing cart-related data.
Components inside the CartContextProvider can access shared cart data and functions.

3. Dynamic Routing
Dynamic Parameter (:productId):
Allows viewing details of a specific product based on its unique productId.
Example: Navigating to /product/123 will load the SingleProduct component with details of product 123.

##Key Features
###Component-Based Architecture:

Each page or feature is encapsulated in its own React component, making the app modular and maintainable.
###React Router:

Provides declarative routing for seamless navigation without page reloads.
###Global State Management:

The CartContextProvider allows centralized management of cart state across the application.
###Dynamic Route Matching:

The :productId parameter supports dynamic paths, making it easy to implement features like viewing product details.
#Usage
Install Dependencies:
Ensure react-router-dom is installed:

npm install react-router-dom
File Structure:
Organize components under the ./component folder and the CartContext in the ./context folder.

Run the Application:
Start the React application:

npm start
This setup is ideal for building a basic e-commerce website or any React app requiring routing and context management.
